>      First, let me state some of the philosophy behind RPM.  One design goal
      was to allow the use of "pristine" sources.  With RPP (our former
      packaging system of which <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>none</I
> of RPM is derived),
      our source packages were the "hacked" sources that we built from.
    </P
><P
>      Theoretically, one could install a source RPP and then
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>make</I
> it with no problems.  But the sources were not
      the original ones, and there was no reference as to what changes we had to
      make to get it to build.  One had to download the pristine sources
      separately.  With RPM, you have the pristine sources along with patches
      that we used to compile from.  We see this as a big advantage.  Why?
      Several reasons.  For one, if a new version of a program comes out, you
      don't necessarily have to start from scratch to get it to compile under
      RHL.  You can look at the patch to see what you <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>might</I
>
      need to do.  All the compile-in defaults are easily visible this way.
    </P
><P
>      RPM is also designed to have powerful querying options.  You can do
      searches through your entire database for packages or just certain files.
      You can also easily find out what package a file belongs to and where it
      came from.  The RPM files themselves are compressed archives, but you can
      query individual packages easily and <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>quickly</I
> because
      of a custom binary header added to the package with everything you could
      possibly need to know contained in uncompressed form.  This allows for
      <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>fast</I
> querying.
    </P
><P
>      Another powerful feature is the ability to verify packages.  If you are
      worried that you deleted an important file for some package, just verify
      it.  You will be notified of any anomalies.  At that point, you can
      reinstall the package if necessary.  Any config files that you had are
      preserved as well.
    </P

>      We would like to thank the folks from the BOGUS distribution for many of
      their ideas and concepts that are included in RPM.  While RPM was
      completely written by Red Hat, Inc., its operation is based on code
      written by BOGUS (PM and PMS).
